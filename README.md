# Complete guide to DevOps

DevOps is a feild growing across the globe with very limited resource available for young minds to work in this feild. Here in this repo i'll be providing you with everything that you require to go from zero to hero in the domain of DevOps!. I've also followed this article ( https://roadmap.sh/devops ), you all can also use it, however what I'll be doing is that I'd be adding further insights on each of the concepts explain in this article.

# Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is the acronym given to the combination of Development and Operations. It refers to a collaborative approach to make the Application Development team and the IT Operations team of an organization to seamlessly work with better communication. In other words DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations.

As the name suggest DevOps comprises of two major parts, Development & Operations which are further divided into 4 subparts as shown below. We'll be discussing every of these parts down the road in this guide.

# Learning a Programing language

In order to start of with DevOps you need to have grasp over any of the following languages:

  - Python
  - Ruby on Rails
  - Javascript
  - GO etc.

My personal opinion would be to go with python because of its focus on readability, consistency, and ease of use, code is executed as soon as it is written and the Python syntax allows functionality, procedural or object-oriented programmatic ways of coding. However if you dig deep into various domains of python, you might find task in which python is not very performant.


# Different Operating System Concepts

In order to have a good understanding of how development and operation works, you need to know various operating system concepts that play a vital role in operations and are considered highly while developing applications. A breif of concepts is given below and their details will be shared in a seperate repo:

  - Startup Management (init.d)
  - Service Management (systemd)
  - Thread & Concurrency in OS 
  - I/O management & Virtualizations
  - Memory/Storage & File systems
  - Networking & POSIX
  - Sockets and Processes

# Learning about Managing servers

Server management includes all of the monitoring and maintenance required for servers to operate reliably and at optimal performance levels. The primary goals of an effective server management strategy are to:

 - Build secure server environments.
 - Minimize server slowdowns and downtime while maximizing reliability.
 - Scale servers and related operations to meet organizational needs.



This repo is still in progress, I'll be updating it as soon as I make detailed repo on individual topics mentioned in this one!
So keep visiting!

# Learning a Programing language

In order to start of with DevOps you need to have grasp over any of the following languages:
  - Python
  - Ruby on Rails
  - Javascript
  - GO etc.

My personal opinion would be to go with python because of its focus on readability, consistency, and ease of use, code is executed as soon as it is written and the Python syntax allows functionality, procedural or object-oriented programmatic ways of coding. However if you dig deep into various domains of python, you might find task in which python is not very performant.
